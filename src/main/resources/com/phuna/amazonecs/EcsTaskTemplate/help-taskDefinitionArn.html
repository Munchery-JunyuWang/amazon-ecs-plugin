  Task definitions are basically ECS wrappers around one or many docker images, and allow you to define things like cpu and memory usage, commands to run, and number of containers to run. These can be created in the AWS console, or if you're feeling programmy, you coud even add the ability to create them straight from this plugin using the AWS sdk :).
